# Modifier Fragments (~11)

## Brief

This feature authors the `prompts/modifiers/` fragments: `bold, tdd, debug, flow, muse, readonly, methodical, director, speak-plain, context-pacing, playful`. Each is one short modifier brief (zero or more apply per mode).

Voice/source per the epic's locked decisions: adapt-port from
`../claude-code-modes`, stripping Claude-Code-specific framing (tool lists,
"Claude Code" self-references, CC mechanics) and fitting pi's
transform-not-replace model. Each fragment is ONE focused behavioral brief
(heading + short prose), no dynamic text/timestamps (the splice is byte-stable).
The `fragment-loader` already shipped a minimal STARTER file per type; this
feature fills out the full set, replacing/extending the starter where needed so
discovery picks them up by convention.

This feature authors content ONLY — it does not change the engine, resolver, or
cache. No-code-surface ([prose]).

## Epic context
- Parent epic: `epic-fragment-library`
- Position: **independent content authoring; parallel with the other content
  features. `preset-bundles` depends on this (its presets reference these files).**

## Foundation references
- `docs/SPEC.md` — "Mode composition" (the value lists + assembly order).
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — "Fragment library" (layer semantics, convention dirs).
- `src/fragments.ts` (landed) — the loader these files feed (convention discovery,
  filename = value name).

## Inherited / epic design decisions (do not re-litigate)
- **Adapt-port from `../claude-code-modes`**, fit transform-not-replace, strip CC
  framing.
- **Base overlays are thin tone-setters** (one short paragraph; no tool/identity/
  context restatement) — applies to base-overlays.
